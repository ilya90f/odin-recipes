    <p><em>Ingridients : </em></p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Cup Milk</li>
        <li>1 Cup Flour</li>
        <li>1 Spoon sugar</li>
        <li>sprikle salt</li>
        <li>Half Spoon soda powder</li>
        <li>half spoon Homez</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Cooking Steps : </em></p>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium sized mixing bowl sieve in the flour and salt to remove any lumps. Set to the side.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the microwave or in a small saucepan. Set to the side to cool.</li>
        <li>In a smaller mixing bowl crack in the two eggs and pour in the milk. Use a whisk to combine the ingredients together really well. Make sure there is no stringy bits from the egg.</li>
        <li>Pour a 1/3 of the egg and milk mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a whisk to combine the ingredients together well until there are no longer any lumps.</li>
        <li>Add another 1/3 and repeat the process.</li>
        <li>Finally add the remaining wet ingredients and the melted butter. Whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl and place into the fridge for at least 30 minutes or overnight. This will let the Crepe batter relax and stop any tearing while cooking.</li>
        <li>When you are ready to cook the crepes remove the bowl from the fridge and give it a quick whisk.</li>
        <li>Heat a large frypan or a crepe pan over medium heat. A crepe pan isn't necessary but it makes the job easier if you cook crepes often.</li>
        <li>Grease the pan with the smallest amount of butter and pour in 1/3 cup of crepe mixture. Tilt the pan to spread the batter evenly or use a crepe tool.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium low heat for about a minute or until the top looks set. Use a spatula to flip the crepe over and cook on the other side for about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, adjusting the heat if the crepes are cooking too fast or getting too much color.</li>
        <li>Fill your Crepes with your favorite fillings and either roll up or fold in half twice to get a wedge shape.</li>
    </ol>
